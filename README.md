# Voice-Controlled Pong

This is a small hobby project where I tried to learn **C#** by building something I usually make when learning a new language â€” **Pong**.

This time, I added a twist and attempted to make it **voice-controlled**.

The game uses a voice recognition library to move the paddle based on voice commands. Unfortunately, the voice control works... pretty badly â€” mostly due to limitations in the library I used. ðŸ˜…

Still, it was a fun and quirky learning experience, and a great way to get started with C#.
